## Academic Honesty and Student Conduct

Students need to submit **only their own original work** (e.g. Code, PPT, figures, visualizations…). Student need to familiarize themselves with the academic rules of the University. In case a student is found guilty under the act of plagiarism, his/her test or assignment will be graded zero. 

If plagiarism occurs twice, student will receive ‘F’ grade with immediate effect.  It is expected that everybody turns off/mute all devices that emit sounds and noises that may interrupt the class (e.g. mobile phones, pagers, watch alarms). If an occasion arises, in which a student may need to leave the class to receive a phone call (important call), use rest room or get drinking water, he or she should silently walk out without disturbing rest of the class. 

Working on assignments and project work, that belongs to another course is **STRICTLY NOT ALLOWED**.

Copying your colleagues code is **STRICTLY NOT ALLOWED**. All submissions will be submitted to autodetection plagiarism tool that our university provides!
